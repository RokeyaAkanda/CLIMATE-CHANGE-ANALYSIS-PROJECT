# CLIMATE-CHANGE-ANALYSIS-PROJECT
The Climate Change initiative endeavors to mitigate the global temperature rise to a maximum of 2Â°C by 2100, a critical goal necessitating significant human behavioral shifts and policy reforms. Drawing upon an extensive toolkit of data analysis tools in Excel, including optimization techniques, forecasting, probability and statistics, and sensitivity analysis, we meticulously assess carbon emissions across vital sectors such as energy supply, transportation, land use, and industry. By meticulously manipulating key parameters within these sectors, we generate robust forecasts of carbon emissions over diverse timeframes. Our analysis harnesses advanced forecasting methodologies like t-testing significance and ANOVA, providing invaluable insights to refine predictions and facilitate the development of targeted mitigation strategies.
